# android-permision-checker
Using Android SDK to build a permission checker application

he theme of the Hackathon was "Secure our World". We built an android application that fetches all the applications installed on your phone and shows you the permissions requested by the aforementioned applications.
The user has the option to browse a set of risky permissions and know which applications are using them within his system.
